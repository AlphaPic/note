1.In order to prevent people from acquiring red packet by requesting the interface through the robot,and prevent the trade under desk,we leaded risk control sys into our project,control the different user behavior by adding a global switch and add the signature to our system.
2.In order to make the revenue more intuitive,we made some graph by building some dynamic data model and static data model through a inside tool which named unicorn by the developer from our data group.
